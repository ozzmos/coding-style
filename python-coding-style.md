### Indentation

Do not use tabs to indent code.

Use 4 spaces per indentation level.  

### Maximum line length

Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.  
Continuation lines should align wrapped elemenets vertically.

You can cut long text with an apostrophe
```
print('Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.  Donec a'  
      ' diam lectus. Sed sit amet ipsum mauris. Maecenas congue ligula '
      ' ac  quam viverra nec consectetur ante hendrerit.')
```

You can also cut after a colon
```
foo = long_function_name(var one, var two,
                         var three, var four)
```

Or before a plus sign
```
print('Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec '
      + end_of_text)
```

### Blank lines

Class definitions and to-level function are separated by two blank lines.  

Method definitions inside a class are separated by a single blank line.  

### Imports

Imports are always put at the top of the file, after modules comments and docstrings and before module globals and constants.  

Imports should be grouped in the following order:  
1. standard library imports  
2. related third party imports  
3. local application/library specific imports  

Each group should be separated by a blank line.  

Do not use relative path but absolute path.   
```
from foo.bar.yourclass import YourClass
```

Import should usually be on a separate lines.  
```
import os
import sys
```

However it's okay to say:
```
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
```

### Naming conventions

Never use the characters'l'(lowercase letter el), 'O'(uppercase letther oh), or 'I(uppercase letter eye) as single character variable name.  

In some fonts these characters are indistinguishable from the numerals one and zero.  

**variable** : lowercase, underscores can be used to improve readability  
```
firstname = 'John'
```
**global variable**:  lowercase, underscores can be used to improve readability  

```
i = 5
def incr_i():
    global i
    i += 1
```
**function** : lowercase, underscores can be used to improve readability  
```
def show_firstname():
```
**class** : use CapWords convention  
```
class UserTest(object):
```
Classes for internal use have a leading underscore in addition.  
```
class _UserTest(object):
```
**exception** : use CapWords convention with suffix "Error"
```
class MyExceptionError(Exception):
      def __init__(self, reason):
          self.reason = reason
      
      def __str__(self):
          return self.reason
```
**method** : lowercase, underscores can be used to improve readability  
```
def create_user(self):
```
**module** : short lowercase name, use of underscores is discouraged  
```
import busconnection 
```
### Whitespace in expressions and statements


One space around an assignement, augmented assignement(+=,-=,etc.) or other operator(==,<,>,!=,<>,<=,>=,in,not in,is,is not), Booleans(and,or,not).  
```
x = 1
if x == 4:
```

One space after a colon
```
def test(self, name):
```

### Comments

Should be a complete sentence. If a comment is a phrase or a sentence, its first word should be capitalized.

#### Inline comments

Use inline comments sparingly  
Should be separated by at least two spaces from the statement  

#### Block Comments

Block comments generally apply to some(or all) code that follows them, and are indented to the same level as the code. Each line of a block comment starts with a # and a single space.  

Paragraphs inside a block are separated by a line containing a single #.  

#### Documentation Strings

A docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class or method definition.
This becomes the __doc__ attribute of the object.

Docstrings should be written for every public module, function, class or method and describe what it does.  
A package may be documented in the module docstring of the __init__.py file in the package directory.  

Always use triple double quotes around docstrings.  

One-line docstring:  

```
def kos_root():
    """Return the pathname of the KOS root directory."""
    global _kos_root
    if _kos_root: return _kos_root
    ...

```

Multi-line docstring:  
```
def complex(real=0.0, imag=0.0):
    """Form a complex number.

    Keyword arguments:
    real -- the real part (default 0.0)
    imag -- the imaginary part (default 0.0)
    """
    if imag == 0.0 and real == 0.0:
        return complex_zero
    ...
```
