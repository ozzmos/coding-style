## JavaScript

### Table of content


### JavaScript files

JavaScript files should be saved as .js files.  
The code should not be embedded in HTML files unless the code is specific to a single session.  
The JavaScript tag should be placed as late in the body as possible to reduces delays.  
No need to use the language or type attributes. They are determined by the server.  
### Indentation

Do not use tabs to indent code.

Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
